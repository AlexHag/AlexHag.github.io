      <h2>&lt/salt&gt</h2>
      <h3>Passion to Profession</h3>
      <p>I started my career at &lt/salt&gt as the youngest software developer ever at the company. Taking an intensive three month training program for full stack web development in .NET where I learned an API-first approach, different database management systems using entity framework, and frontend skills in react. We also learned dependency injection design patterns, DevOps skills in Azure and the amazing potential of docker and containerized applications. It was an amazing experience where I met some wonderful people. Together with my colleges, we built a decentralized platform for handling digital signatures using RSA digital signature algorithms. Building such a project gave me hands-on experience with all the different parts of software development and agile work methods.</p>

      <h2>Fundler</h2>
      <h3>Setting the new standard for simplified investments</h2>
      <p>My experience as a software developer in the financial industry has equipped me with a deeper understanding of the financial markets and the critical role technology plays a part in. My main responsibility was to decouple the current monolithic architecture into a more modern microservice based architecture. I got to work with an amazing team and learned different ways of working with Scrum. Here I developed a compliance module and wrote anti money laundering algorithms that identified suspicious transactions. The module also handled the validation and storage of KYC answers in a GDPR-compliant way. I got the opportunity to design an implementation for a new deposit system responsible for creating model portfolios, handling money transactions, and placing trades on the market for funds and ETFs. This experience has not only sharpened my technical skills but also my ability to communicate and collaborate effectively within cross-functional teams.</p>

      <h2>Private Tutor</h2>
      <h3>Mathematics</h3>
      <p>I have five years of experience working as a private tutor in mathematics and science. My goal is not just for my students to achieve a higher grade but also to develop an actual interest within the field. How many times have you heard students say they hate math? The way it is taught in schools is a big disappointment that often makes people unmotivated and leads to the perception that math is boring. It doesn't have to be like this. Teaching mathematics in an interactive and intuitive way will give a deeper understanding and appreciation of the beauty it has to offer. I have always enjoyed teaching and helping students see math the way I do. Unfortunately, I do not provide private tutoring lessons anymore but can refer you to some amazing teachers.</p>

    <h1>My interests apart from Software Development</h1>
    <div class="interests">
      <div class="interests-item">
        <h2>Cryptography</h2>
        <p>For me it's not just about keeping information secure and authentic but about how the algorithms are so beautifully connected to other fields and branches of mathematics. From elliptic curves to modular forms, to solving the Riemann hypothesis.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="interests-item">
        <h2>Quantum Computing</h2>
        <p>The amount of potential quantum computing has and what it will be able to achieve in the future is mind boggling. The exponentially superior computational power it has will be able to calculate models that were previously thought to be impossible.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="interests-item">
        <h2>Mathematics</h2>
        <p>I think math is one of the most beautiful things in the world. The elegance of simplicity and the universality of mathematical truth is where I find my inspiration. I truly believe that it is the language of god and our duty to explore its depth.</p>
